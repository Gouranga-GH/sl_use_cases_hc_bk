# Supervised Learning - Use Cases

## Problem Statement

The project focuses on applying supervised learning techniques to real-world industry datasets from different domains, such as healthcare and banking. The objective is to build machine learning models that can predict outcomes based on the given datasets and conditions. 

### Domain 1: Healthcare
- **Context**: A medical research university is conducting a study on patients with specific conditions. To ensure confidentiality, patient details and conditions are masked. The provided dataset includes various biomechanical features that are used to predict a patient's condition.
- **Dataset**: Biomechanical features (P_incidence, P_tilt, L_angle, S_slope, P_radius, S_degree, and Class).

### Domain 2: Banking
- **Context**: A bank is undergoing digital transformation, focusing on expanding its borrower base. Historical data is provided, and the goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to convert, helping the bank optimize its marketing efforts.
- **Dataset**: Customer information such as age, mortgage, security, credit card usage, etc.

## Objectives
1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Import, explore, and merge datasets.
   - Perform data cleansing by correcting datatypes and handling missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to extract insights from the data.
   - Create visualizations to understand trends and relationships between attributes.

3. **Data Pre-processing**:
   - Segregate predictors and target variables.
   - Handle target imbalance (if any) and apply normalization or scaling.

4. **Model Training and Tuning**:
   - Train machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes.
   - Apply model tuning techniques to find the best possible hyperparameters.
   - Evaluate model performance using classification reports and accuracy scores.

5. **Conclusion and Recommendations**:
   - Provide a conclusion on model performance.
   - Suggest improvements or enhancements on data quality for better future predictions.
